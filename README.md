Exploring stats questions about Basketball

First question: Is it true that Lamarcus Aldridge, Brandon Roy, and Greg Oden played in 62 games together and they went 50-12 in total?
I've seen this stat around the internet, and reported it to a friend who said they heard it wasn't correct.

To run this script: download the .py file into a directory and run it in a terminal. The script automatically outputs a line for each game, and the line contains whetehr the game was a portland win or loss, and the number of minutes each player played. Finally, it returns the wins and losses in an array. It looks like my final answer is: 53-29
